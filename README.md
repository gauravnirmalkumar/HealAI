# HealAI

HealAI is an AI-powered application designed to assist diabetic patients, particularly those suffering from diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). The app enables patients to upload images of their wounds, which are analyzed using AI to calculate wound size and track healing over time. Doctors can monitor the healing process remotely, reducing the need for frequent in-person visits.

## Features

- **Wound Image Upload**: Patients can upload images of their wounds through the app.
- **AI-Powered Wound Analysis**: The app processes images to calculate wound size and track healing progress.
- **Doctor Monitoring**: Doctors set the frequency of image uploads and can review healing progress remotely.
- **Visual Healing Tracking**: Patients and doctors get a clear view of healing over time through AI-generated insights.
- **Reduced Physical Visits**: Helps minimize unnecessary hospital visits, saving time and reducing costs for patients.

## Technology Stack

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Used for wound size detection and healing analysis.
- **Flutter SDK**: Used for app development.
- **Android Studio**: Development environment for building and testing the app.

## Purpose

HealAI aims to improve doctor-patient connections by providing remote wound monitoring solutions, making healthcare more accessible and efficient for diabetic patients.

## Development Status

- The project is being developed as a mini-project for CIP67/CYP67 (March - June 2025).
- Efforts are ongoing to improve AI model performance and document enhancements.

## Future Plans

- Enhance model accuracy for better wound analysis.
- Improve UI/UX for a seamless patient experience.
- Expand the application's capabilities based on user feedback.
